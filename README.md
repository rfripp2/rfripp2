### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



Nice to meet you! :)

Here you can see the projects I have been working on, besides the grouped project that we did with friends from the Henry Boot Camp https://github.com/martinnegro/Psitesis/

Skills I know are JS, React, Node, SQL, Sequelize, HTML and CSS, always looking to keep learning as I understand the technology grows so fast! And these technologies are also super fun to play with, sky is the limit they say! Or higher, I would say.

My passions besides programming are poker (ex professional online poker player), crypto, and art ðŸ˜„
If you want to reach me for work/ideas you can find me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juangonzalezvenzano/)
